# My Memory at MESA
My best memory at MESA would probably the *Bonding trip* at **Pocono's valley**. Specificly the zipline arcoss the lake. It was exciting and fun. I was there with my friend **HaoYu**. A funny moment was when i said to him "Ill go when u go" and without hesitation he went, i was stuned for a bit becasue i thought he would have told me, like "3...2..1.. Go" but no he just jumped.It was a tall jump in the beginng but it was fun, really *loud* though.
